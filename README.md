# Ivory's Niri Dotfiles :3

A personal collection of my Linux config files, and systemd services.

My current goal is having a minimal yet functional system that I find comfortable to use. Once that goal is reached I plan on re-implementing it in Quickshell to make the aesthetics more consistent.

Please do note that this is still a work in progress as I'm new to ricing and I will make a lot of adjustments as I learn more c:
This rice is not yet fully implemented for laptops, and it's something I will work on.
